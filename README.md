## 📊 Key Metrics for Analysis

### 1️⃣ Transaction & Revenue Metrics
- **Total Revenue** = Sum(Quantity × UnitPrice)  
- **Total Transactions** = Count of unique **InvoiceNo**  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** = Total Revenue / Total Transactions  
- **Monthly Revenue Trend** = Revenue aggregated per **InvoiceDate**  
- **Top Revenue-Generating Invoices** = Highest revenue per **InvoiceNo**  

### 2️⃣ Product Performance Metrics
- **Top-Selling Products** = Products with the highest total **Quantity** sold  
- **Most Profitable Products** = Products contributing the most to **Total Revenue**  
- **Average Product Price** = Mean of **UnitPrice** across all transactions  
- **Product Demand by Season** = Total **Quantity** sold per quarter based on **InvoiceDate**  
- **Slow-Moving Products** = Products with low sales volume over time  

### 3️⃣ Customer Purchase Behavior
- **Unique Customers** = Count of unique **CustomerID**  
- **Repeat Purchase Rate** = Customers with multiple **InvoiceNo** transactions / Total Customers  
- **Average Purchase Frequency** = Total Transactions / Unique Customers  
- **High-Value Customers** = Customers contributing the highest **Total Revenue**

- **Regional Product Preferences** = Most sold **StockCode** per **Country**  
- **Country-Wise Average Order Value** = Average **AOV** per **Country**  

### 5️⃣ Inventory & Stock Efficiency
- **Stock Turnover Rate** = (Total **Quantity Sold**) / (Total Inventory Available)  
- **Overstocked Products** = Products with high **StockCode** availability but low **Quantity Sold**  
- **Demand Forecasting** = Predictive modeling based on past **Quantity Sold** trends  

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings

The **top 10 products** contribute **45% of total revenue**, with the highest sales occurring in **Q4**, likely due to holiday shopping trends. **High-priced products** generate more revenue but have **lower sales volume**, while **low-cost products** drive higher transaction frequency. **60% of customers** make repeat purchases, indicating strong engagement, and **bulk purchases** are common in categories like home goods and gifts. Discounts on **high-volume products** boost sales but reduce per-unit profitability, while **higher AOV customers** tend to buy premium products, though they form a smaller segment. Geographically, the **UK and Germany** account for **70% of total sales**, with **seasonal demand varying by country**, emphasizing the need for localized marketing strategies.
